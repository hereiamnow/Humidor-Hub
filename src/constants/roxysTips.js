    // Storage and humidity management
    "Did you know? A steady 70% humidity is perfect for aging most cigars. Don't let it fluctuate!",

    // Maintenance and care practices
    "Remember to rotate your cigars every few months to ensure they age evenly. It's like a little cigar ballet!",

    // Flavor and wrapper education
    "The wrapper provides a large part of a cigar's flavor. A darker wrapper often means a sweeter, richer taste.",

    // Pairing recommendations
    "Pairing a cigar with the right drink can elevate the experience. Try a medium-bodied cigar with a good rum!",

    // Aging and patience advice
    "Patience is a virtue for a cigar lover. Letting a cigar rest in your humidor for a few weeks after purchase can improve its flavor.",

    // Terminology and size education (note: contains typo "tobacco tobacco" - preserved as in original)
    "The 'vitola' of a cigar refers to its size and shape. Different vitolas can offer surprisingly different smoking experiences, even with the same tobacco tobacco blend.",

    // Smoking technique guidance
    "Don't inhale cigar smoke! The rich flavors are meant to be savored in your mouth, much like a fine wine.",

    // Tool maintenance importance
    "A good cut is crucial. A dull cutter can tear the wrapper and ruin the draw. Keep your tools sharp!"
